# DAGBOK

DAGBOK is an open-source platform designed to be a professional diary where users can document their daily work experiences, learnings, attended lectures, completed courses, earned certificates, soft skills, hard skills, new job experiences, and career milestones. Using Artificial Intelligence, the system automatically generates a well-structured resume based on the user’s diary entries.

## Features

- **Professional Diary:** Log daily work experiences, skills, and achievements.
- **AI-Powered Resume Generation:** Automatically creates a well-structured resume based on diary entries.
- **Smart Updates:** If the diary is more up-to-date than the resume, the system reprocesses the resume to include the latest skills and experiences.
- **Intuitive Web Interface:** Easily manage and update your professional history.

## How It Works

1. Users log into their DAGBOK profile.
2. They add new entries to their professional diary (courses, certifications, skills, job transitions, etc.).
3. The system checks if the diary is more up-to-date than the resume.
4. If needed, the AI reprocesses the resume to reflect the latest changes.
5. The updated resume is displayed in the user’s profile.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React & TypeScript)
- **AI Integration:** Processes diary entries into structured resume data

##Personal Note

Tribute to DJ Avicii

The name DAGBOK comes from the Swedish word dagbok, which means "diary" in the Swedish language. I specifically chose a Swedish word as a tribute to one of my biggest idols, DJ Avicii. His loss in 2018 was not only deeply saddening for me but also a devastating moment for the entire electronic music world.

Avicii was much more than just a DJ—he was a visionary, a storyteller, and one of the greatest electronic music composers in history. His songs carried deep emotions, powerful messages, and touched millions of people around the globe. His music has been a huge inspiration in my journey, and naming this project with a Swedish word is my way of honoring his incredible legacy.

"One day you'll leave this world behind, so live a life you will remember." – Avicii, The Nights
